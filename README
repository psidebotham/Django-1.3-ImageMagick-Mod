Django ImageMagick Mod


Overview:
This project exists because I was unable to get PIL working correctly in my fastcgi environment for bluehost shared linux hosting.

Django models.ImageField depends on PIL. Also, thumbnailing for the feincms medialibrary content type depends on PIL.

This project contains replacement versions for the specific files that depend on PIL to switch to the ImageMagick convert command.

Versioning Issues:
Currently the files are a drop in replacement for Django 1.3, and Feincms 1.3. If running a later version diff the files to make sure things are current. Also, the files will have to be re-applied every time you update to a newer version.

Security Issues:
Because this code works by calling command line programs (convert and identify) it opens Django up for a command injection attack. The new code does NOT do input sanitation, so it should not be used in contexts where untrusted input is provided for the filename.
